# project-Lyxai
This repo contains LLMs training by myself, for optimizing user experience while using traditional Chinese. LLMs will be trained specific field knowledge or characteristic.

# Purpose

1. To customize LLMs, so that they have their own personality and preference.

2. Have a nice experience on talking to the AI.

3. Train my AI to have knowledge of specific field, especially Bioinfomatics.

# Goal

1. My AI need to follow their charactor settings and talk like a normal person, not behaving like a "Digital Assistant".

2. My AI can use workflow and searching to solve problem.

3. My AI can read data and do the analysis + data visualization.

4. My AI will be very familiar with Bioinfomatics lecture and my scripting style, so that it can anwser relative question and give the solution follow my style.

5. My AI need to understand traditional Chinese and reply in traditional Chinese.

# Method

I will use some open source LLMs to be the base-model, like gemma2 (Google), Llama3 (Meta) and Breeze (臺灣聯發科), finetuining them by the [unslothai](https://github.com/unslothai/unsloth) package. 

I use my own PC with RTX4070 and 32 GB RAM. 

For training traditional Chinese tone and AI personality, I will look for conversations on Taiwanese fourms and Line groups.

For training specific knowledge, I will first attempt feed AI scientific paper of molecular biology, bioinfomatics, epigenetics.

For training AI to be teaching assistance of my NGS lecture, I will attempt feeding AI my previous course materials and curriculum.
